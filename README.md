How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I would start by gathering information about the prospective users. This can be a list of demographic information such as age, gender and location. I would gather this information through the use of user interviews, surveys, or other research methods. Next, I would identify the users' needs. I could do this by asking them open ended questions, or by asking them whether there is a specific problem they would like the software to solve. I would also make sure to identify specific functionalities and features users would like using the same strategies. 

After the information gathering phase, I would create user stories from the gathered information. I would create these by considering a combination of the users' dempgraphic informations and the requested functionalities of the software. These user stories should be short and concise descriptions of the features and functionalities requested by the users. I would then prioritize the user stories based on the value it provides to the users. Additionally, the complexity of the implementation of the task should also be considered.

Finally, I would start implementing the user stories into the software going from the most important to the least. If in an agile environment, I would implement the user stories in small incremental "sprints".

Collecting and creating user stories from users is a great way to address the needs of users. This is so because user stories are: small, clear, specific, testable, and independent of each other. These aspects of user stories make them ideal to use for user need implementations.



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing a program requires a number of steps: planning, preparing requirements, choosing a development process plan, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. With this, there are several agile development processes that I wish to incorporate into my future development work, some of which include Scrum, Kanban, and Lean process. Scrum is the most interesting to me since it is capable of managing and developing complex projects. It is based on the idea of quick, iterative development in which the product is developed in incremental cycles called sprints.



What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
